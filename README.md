This project contain a set of algorithms implemented with different programing languages, feel free to contribute even by updating this README

this project is based on the coursera course : Functional Programming Principles in Scala

### Implemented so far :

* Pascalâ€™s Triangle :

The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it.

exemple pascal(0,2)=1 : 
```
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```
* Parentheses Balancing :
