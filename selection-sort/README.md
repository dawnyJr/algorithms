## Summary
Selection sort is an in place comparison sort algorithm. It has the advantage of not using auxiliary memory. 
The algorithm starts by looking for the smallest item on the array and putting it on the first position. Then repeats the same operation for the remaining N-1 items (N is the length of the array). 

The algorithm maintains two sub-arrays: 
* The unsorted subarray
* The sorted subarray formed from the smallest item of the unsorted sub-arrays in each iteration.

The algorithm has a complexity of O(nÂ²).

## Uses
* Sort an array
