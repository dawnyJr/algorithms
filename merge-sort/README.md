## Summary

The merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm used to sort an array of elements. 
The algorithm works as follows: 
1. Divide the array into n sublists containing 1 element 
2. Merge adjacent singleton lists in sorted 2 element lists .
3. Repeat until a single sorted list is obtained

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n).
